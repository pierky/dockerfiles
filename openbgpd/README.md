# How to use the `latest` image

Put the [OpenBGPD](https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.conf.5) configuration into `bgpd/bgpd.conf`...

```
# mkdir bgpd
# vim bgpd/bgpd.conf
```

... then run the image in detached mode (`-d`) with the local `bgpd` directory mounted in `/etc/bgpd`:

```
# docker run -d -v `pwd`/bgpd:/etc/bgpd:rw pierky/openbgpd
```
