# How to use the `latest` image

Put the [BIRD startup config](http://bird.network.cz/?get_doc&f=bird.html) into `bird/bird.conf`...

```
# mkdir bird
# vim bird/bird.conf
```

... then run the image in detached mode (`-d`) with the local `bird` directory mounted in `/etc/bird`:

```
# docker run -d -v `pwd`/bird:/etc/bird:rw pierky/bird
```

You can verify that `log` gets populated: `cat bird/log`.

Run `docker ps` to get the running container's ID (`153b6165385f` in the example below), then use it to run BIRD's client:

```
# docker exec -it 153b6165385f birdcl
BIRD 1.6.1 ready.
bird> show status
BIRD 1.6.1
Router ID is 192.0.2.4
Current server time is 2016-09-28 16:41:06
Last reboot on 2016-09-28 16:29:24
